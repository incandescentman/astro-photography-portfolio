* Implementation History

** 2025-10-19 - Highlight Delivery Fixes & Responsive Pipeline

*** Problems Observed
- *Production 404s*: Vercel deployments served 404 for `/highlights/*.webp` even though local builds succeeded.
- *Slow visual paint*: Homepage masonry waited on multi-megabyte originals, causing long blank gaps before images appeared.
- *Existing lint debt*: Repository-wide ESLint run still blocks on historical `no-undef`/`no-unused-vars` errors unrelated to this change.

*** Root Causes
- `.gitignore` excluded all `*.webp`, so optimized highlight assets were never pushed to Vercel and the build emitted references to missing files.
- The homepage rewrote every filename to `.webp` and rendered them directly without `srcset`, forcing browsers to download full-resolution sources regardless of viewport context.

*** Solutions Implemented
- *Versioned WebP assets*: Removed the `*.webp` ignore rule and committed the highlight derivatives so production can serve the requested files.
- *Astro asset pipeline*: Replaced manual string-based URLs with eager `import.meta.glob` of the highlight originals and used `getImage()` to precompute responsive WebP/JPEG variants sized per layout role.
- *Responsive markup*: Swapped `<Image>` usage for `<picture>` + `<img>` tags that expose generated `srcset`/`sizes`, letting the browser choose optimal variants while keeping the lightbox anchored to the high-quality JPEG.
- *Structured data parity*: Updated JSON-LD and social metadata to reference the resized JPEG output so crawlers receive consistent assets.

*** Implementation Notes
- New helper maps highlight filenames to imported metadata (~src/pages/index.astro:14-33~) and caches responsive variants per unique image (~src/pages/index.astro:391-457~).
- Rendering layer now pulls variant info via `responsiveInfoFor` and emits `<picture>` elements for stacked and single masonry tiles (~src/pages/index.astro:638-752~).
- Added a symlink (`src/assets/highlights`) pointing to `public/highlights` so Astro can process originals without duplicating media in the repo.
- Astro build now generates 382 responsive assets; first run takes ~27s, subsequent builds reuse cache.

*** Outstanding Items
- ESLint continues to fail on legacy global references (e.g., ~src/pages/index.astro:36~, ~salient-portfolio.js~); not addressed in this iteration.
- Investigate long-term strategy for linting browser globals or restructuring legacy scripts to reduce noise when running `npm run lint`.

** 2025-09-06 - Reordering, Inline Editor, and Persistence Upgrades

*** Summary
- Added robust, filename-based reorder persistence (local + server).
- Introduced an inline, in-tile editor (caption + size) with a compact, elegant UI.
- Improved admin workflow: hover ✎ button and hold-~e~ shortcut to reveal edit affordances; safe event handling prevents unintended navigation.
- Hardened API endpoint to accept flexible JSON bodies and provide clearer errors.

*** User Experience Improvements
- ~Inline Editor~: Each tile now shows a small ✎ button on hover (in admin mode). Clicking opens a tidy inline popover anchored to that tile.
  - ~Caption~: multi-line textarea with clean focus ring.
  - ~Size~: segmented control (Portrait | Landscape | XL Portrait) that does not change layout until you click Save.
  - ~Stacked items~: size control hidden; caption only.
- ~Edit key~: hold ~e~ to reveal ✎ buttons across all tiles for quick access.
- ~No navigation while editing~: capture-phase listeners block anchor/lightbox behavior when using ✎ or while holding ~e~.
- ~Reorder by drag~: Admin can drag tiles (Draggabilly + Packery). Sequence auto-saves to ~localStorage~ on drag end.
- ~Admin toolbar~: Save Sequence, Reset, Export controls at the top when ~?admin=true~.

*** Persistence and Data Flow
- ~Local restore~: Reorder state is saved to ~localStorage.photoOrder~ as an array of filenames. On load, the DOM is reordered by matching filenames. For legacy data, a caption-based fallback is preserved.
- ~Server save~: Clicking “Save Sequence” posts the full array of objects ~[{ filename, caption, size }, ...]~ to ~/api/save-order~ and writes to ~src/data/saved-order.json~.
- ~API robustness~: ~src/pages/api/save-order.ts~ accepts either a raw array body or ~{ order: [...] }~, and also tolerates “first array property” on arbitrary objects. JSON parsing supports both ~application/json~ and raw text.
- ~Diagnostics~: The server logs a brief ~save-order: ...~ summary to the terminal running ~npm run dev~ for debugging.

*** How To Use (Admin)
1. Enable Admin Mode: append ~?admin=true~ to the homepage URL.
2. Resequence:
   - Drag tiles to reorder; order auto-saves locally on drag end.
   - Click “Save Sequence” to persist to the repository’s ~src/data/saved-order.json~.
   - “Reset” clears local order and reloads. “Export” downloads the current order as JSON.
3. Edit Metadata:
   - Hover a tile and click ✎ (or hold ~e~ to reveal all ✎ buttons), then edit.
   - For single images: choose a size via the segmented control; changes apply on Save (no live preview to avoid UI shifting).
   - For stacked pairs: only caption is editable; size is fixed.
   - Press Enter or click Save to persist. Press Esc or click outside to close.

*** Implementation Notes
- ~Filename keys~: All client-side ordering now uses filenames as unique identifiers to avoid caption collisions.
- ~Restore logic~: Builds maps for filename and caption; prefers filename; falls back to caption for legacy arrays.
- ~Event safety~: capture-phase ~mousedown~ and ~click~ prevent default and stop propagation when editing to block navigation and lightbox.
- ~Layout updates~: ~Packery~ relayouts only on Save to avoid jumpiness while selecting a size.
- ~Data attributes~: Each tile carries ~data-filename~ and ~data-size~ for accurate save/export; size also inferred from classes (~regular|wide|wide_tall~) when needed.

*** Files Changed
- ~src/pages/index.astro~
  - Add ✎ button per tile; inline editor popover with Tailwind-style classes.
  - Admin key-handler (hold ~e~), event capture for navigation blocking, and improved restore/save flows.
  - Save/export now include ~{ filename, caption, size }~.
- ~src/pages/api/save-order.ts~
  - Robust JSON parsing, flexible body shape support, clearer error messages, and diagnostics.
- ~src/data/saved-order.json~
  - Receives the canonical order snapshot when saving.

*** Developer Tips
- ~Server logs~: Look in the terminal running ~npm run dev~ for lines starting with ~save-order: ...~ after saving.
- ~Local vs. server state~: The page prefers ~localStorage.photoOrder~ if present. Clearing it (via “Reset”) will reveal the default/build-time order plus any filename-based server snapshot you subsequently load into your data.
- ~Testing~: After edits/reorders, use “Save Sequence” and confirm ~src/data/saved-order.json~ updated. Hard refresh to verify restore honors your latest order.

*** Known Limitations
- ~Server snapshot usage~: The homepage currently persists to ~src/data/saved-order.json~, but loading that file as the default order on initial build is not yet wired; the page relies on client-side restore + configured ~homepage-images.js~. This can be wired at build-time if desired.
- ~Stacked pairs~: Only the first image’s filename is used to identify the stacked tile; the pair is treated as a fixed unit for ordering and sizing.

*** Future Enhancements
- Add toolbar toggle for persistent “Edit Mode” (no need to hold ~e~).
- Optional build-time application of ~saved-order.json~ to default order.
- Server-side validation of filenames against current highlights set.
