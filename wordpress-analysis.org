Here is how they do it on the original wordpress page.

I want to replicate the original wordpress behavior exactly.


Analysis:
There is no custom "sorting" algorithm in that file. Item order follows the DOM order from PHP; the JS initializes Isotope/Packery to lay items out and handles filtering, breakpoints,
  widths, and animation timing.

  Here's the relevant logic in salient-portfolio.js:

- Layout engine: Uses Isotope with Packery
    - Init: If container has .masonry-items, sets layoutMode: 'packery'; otherwise fitRows.
    - Origin: isOriginLeft flips for RTL.
    - Filter: Applies filter: <selector> from data-starting-filter and on category clicks. No sortBy is set; DOM order is preserved.
    - Relayout: Calls this.$el.isotope('layout') after image loads, filtering, and resizing.
    - Relayout: Calls this.$el.isotope('layout') after image loads, filtering, and resizing.
-
  Where order comes from
    - Gallery pages: DOM items are emitted in the order selected in the WPBakery vc_gallery shortcode (handled server-side).
    - Portfolio template: Items are emitted by a WP_Query (default WordPress order unless you customize in PHP).
    - The JS never reorders items; it only shows/hides them via Isotope filters.
-
  Breakpoints and column math (elastic "fullwidth" grids)
    - Fullwidth detection: data-col-num="elastic" → compute widths client-side.
    - Media query tiers: five, four, three, two, one selected in beforeReLayout() based on window width and container modifiers:
    - Base rules:
      - >1600px: `five` (or `four` when constrained/fullwidth-constrained)
      - 1300-1600px: `four` (or `three` when constrained)
      - 990-1300px: `three` (or `four` when constrained)
      - 470-990px: `two`
      - ≤470px: `one`
    - Boxed layout tweaks force smaller tiers.
    - Photography mode: when `[data-masonry-type="photography"]` and not `.no-masonry`, it increases columns by 1 at larger tiers: `five→6`, `four→5`, `three→4`.

- Item width calculation (elastic grids)
    - Let W = container width, colSize = number of columns from tier above.
    - Regular tiles: width = floor(W / colSize).
    - Wide/wide_tall tiles: width = regular width × mult, where mult = 2 except on the one tier where it's 1.
    - If W % colSize != 0, loop i from 1..(6 or 3 on small screens), and for the first i where (W --- i) % colSize == 0, use (W --- i)/colSize to avoid subpixel gaps. This is the "fudge factor" to get
  perfect columns.
    - If W % colSize != 0, loop i from 1..(6 or 3 on small screens), and for the first i where (W --- i) % colSize == 0, use (W --- i)/colSize to avoid subpixel gaps. This is the "fudge factor" to get
  perfect columns.
-
  Height/cropping adjustments (when not bypassing cropping)
    - Determines a reference column class among visible items (regular, wide, wide_tall, or tall) and measures its image height.
    - Sets heights:
    - Tall variants: height = reference height × 2 (+ gutter adjustments).
    - Regular/Wide: same height as reference (or half, depending on which class is the reference).
-
  Applies similar height adjustments to parallax layers.
-
  If .no-masonry and not in a gallery, sets all images to the first visible's height (except style 9/bypass cases).
-
  Filtering behavior
    - Click handlers on .portfolio-filters or .portfolio-filters-inline call isotope({filter: selector}).
    - Updates "active" classes and the visible label (#current-category).
    - Re-groups lightbox links for the current filter selection.
-
  Category list hygiene
    - isotopeCatSelection() scans items for present categories and hides filter entries that don't exist in the current page or in the configured data-categories-to-show.
-
  Lazy loading support
    - For WPBakery gallery with nectar-lazy images, sets temporary width/height based on intrinsic width/height attributes, initializes masonry immediately ('0s' transition), and then calls layout as
  images load.
-
  Animation timing and z-index
    - masonryZindex() reads each item's left offset, groups unique x-positions, and assigns a data-delay-amount per column. That drives staggered reveal timing; it does not alter item order.
    - loadAnimationWaypoint() applies "animated-in" classes when items enter the viewport, with slightly different delays in photography mode.
-
  Other toggles and details
    - Gutter value read from data-gutter="Npx" influences height math.
    - isOriginLeft is set false in RTL to mirror layout direction.

  Summary: Sorting/order is not implemented in JS; it's DOM order from PHP. The JS sets up Isotope/Packery for layout, computes responsive column counts and item widths (with a small pixel-correction
  loop), adjusts heights for tall/wide variants, and handles filtering, lazy-load relayout, and animation staggering.

▌does it use packery or isotope?

Both. It uses Isotope as the engine, with Packery as the layout mode for masonry grids.

- Engine: Isotope (salient/js/build/third-party/isotope.min.js).
- Layout mode: packery when the container has .masonry-items; fitRows otherwise.
- Where set: salient/plugins/salient-portfolio/js/salient-portfolio.js → masonryInit() sets layoutMode: 'packery' for masonry.

* Key Implementation Details for Gap-Free Masonry

** Why Packery vs Standard Masonry
- Packery uses a bin-packing algorithm that actively searches for the best position for each item
- Standard masonry just places items top-to-bottom in columns, leaving gaps
- Packery can place items in any available space, filling gaps more efficiently

** Salient's Exact Implementation
From salient-portfolio.js analysis:

1. Layout initialization:
   #+begin_src javascript
   var $layoutMode = (instance.$el.hasClass('masonry-items')) ? 'packery' : 'fitRows';
   
   instance.$el.isotope({
     itemSelector: '.element',
     filter: $startingFilter,
     layoutMode: $layoutMode,
     transitionDuration: transitionDur,
     isOriginLeft: $rtlLayout,
     packery: {
       gutter: 0
     }
   });
   #+end_src

2. Key configuration differences:
   - Uses Packery layout mode (not masonry)
   - Sets gutter to 0 in Packery config (handles gaps differently)
   - No horizontalOrder setting (Packery handles placement differently)
   - Uses isOriginLeft for RTL support

3. Column width handling:
   - Fixed pixel widths (320px base)
   - Photography mode increases columns by 1 at larger tiers
   - Responsive breakpoints handled separately from layout algorithm

** Migration Strategy for Astro Site

1. Required changes:
   - Load isotope-packery plugin in addition to isotope
   - Change layoutMode from 'masonry' to 'packery'
   - Adjust gutter settings in packery config
   - Remove horizontalOrder (not applicable to packery)

2. Implementation:
   #+begin_src javascript
   // Add to HTML
   <script src="https://unpkg.com/isotope-packery@2/packery-mode.pkgd.min.js"></script>
   
   // Update Isotope config
   const iso = new Isotope(container, {
     itemSelector: '.col',
     layoutMode: 'packery',
     packery: {
       columnWidth: 320,
       gutter: 10,
       horizontal: false
     },
     transitionDuration: '0.3s',
     isOriginLeft: true
   });
   #+end_src

3. Benefits of Packery:
   - Automatically fills gaps left by different-sized items
   - Better handling of mixed portrait/landscape/xlportrait layouts
   - No need for complex reordering algorithms in JavaScript
   - Matches the exact behavior of the WordPress/Salient version

** Update: Packery Integration Issues

When attempting to integrate Packery with the Astro site, encountered loading errors:
- packery-mode.pkgd.min.js requires Outlayer dependency
- Version compatibility issues between Isotope v3 and Packery mode v2
- Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Item')"

Alternative approaches for gap reduction:
1. Use masonry with horizontalOrder: false for vertical optimization
2. Implement custom reordering algorithm to place shorter items at end
3. Consider using CSS Grid with masonry support (experimental)
4. Use Masonry standalone library instead of Isotope

Current solution: Optimized masonry mode with:
- horizontalOrder: false for better vertical packing
- Custom image ordering algorithm in JavaScript
- Strategic placement of different sized items
