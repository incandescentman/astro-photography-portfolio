** Summary
- Added a mobile-only stack layout that bypasses justified-layout so each photo runs edge-to-edge with only a 2px gutter.

** Next Steps
1. QA the gallery on physical mobile hardware to confirm spacing across device pixel ratios.

** Status
- Change staged locally and awaiting tests before merge.

* 2025-10-19
** Summary
- Highlight pipeline now uses Astro-managed responsive variants; verified with build on main.
- ESLint configuration stabilized; `npm run lint` and `npm run build` both succeed.

** Next Steps
1. Replace `salient-portfolio.js` with native Astro/Tailwind components to retire lint exceptions.
2. Refactor Node CLI scripts to typed ES modules and re-enable stricter linting rules.
3. Extend responsive image pipeline to gallery routes for consistent load performance.

** Status
- All work committed and pushed to `main`.
- Ready for pick-up on the follow-up tasks above.
