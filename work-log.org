** Summary
- Completed root cause analysis of mobile gallery gaps (breakpoint mismatch, missing resize handler, absolute positioning persistence)
- Implemented robust solution with responsive layout handler in packeryGallery.ts:
  - Increased mobile breakpoint from 480px → 768px
  - Added setupResponsiveLayoutHandler to detect breakpoint crossing
  - Destroy Packery before applying mobile flex layout
  - Enhanced mobile style resets with !important flags
  - Added debounce helper function
- All changes committed to main with full documentation in docs/debug/mobile-gallery-gaps.org

** Next Steps
1. Test the fix on physical mobile hardware across 480px, 768px, 1024px breakpoints
2. Verify no gaps appear when resizing from desktop → tablet → mobile
3. If successful, mark issue as resolved and update debug doc

** Status
- Implementation complete and committed to main
- Build succeeds without errors
- Ready for testing on actual devices

** Summary
- Highlight pipeline now uses Astro-managed responsive variants; verified with build on main.
- ESLint configuration stabilized; `npm run lint` and `npm run build` both succeed.

** Next Steps
1. Replace `salient-portfolio.js` with native Astro/Tailwind components to retire lint exceptions.
2. Refactor Node CLI scripts to typed ES modules and re-enable stricter linting rules.
3. Extend responsive image pipeline to gallery routes for consistent load performance.

** Status
- All work committed and pushed to `main`.
- Ready for pick-up on the follow-up tasks above.
