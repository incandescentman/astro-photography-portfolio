### Hi, I'm Eli Segal ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software architect by profession reside in israel,
and creativity drives everything I do.
Whether it's capturing fleeting moments through my Leica Q3,
writing and producing music, coding my next idea,
I find inspiration in movement, rhythm, and everyday life.

### ðŸ“· Photography Style

I focus on street, travel, everyday life photography and of course family photography,
seeking raw, authentic, and sometimes unexpected beauty in the world around me.
