I'm a photographer, writer, and AI educator with a passion for capturing authentic moments and telling compelling stories.

- **Major publications** — Published in The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Harvard Business Review, and many others
- **Psychology Today** — Former senior editor, exploring human behavior and psychology

## AI & Innovation

Currently leading **Socratic AI**, where I provide:

- AI education workshops for organizations
- Training on using AI as a creative tool
- Strategic guidance on AI implementation

Previously at **OpenAI**, where I:

## Philosophy

I believe in using technology and creativity to amplify human expression. Whether through a camera lens, the written word, or AI tools, my work focuses on revealing authentic human moments and helping others tell their stories more effectively.
