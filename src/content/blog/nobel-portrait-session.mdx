Capturing the Nobel laureates means working fast with ambient light shifting every minute. I staged the Hopfield portrait against a west-facing window, bouncing a Profoto B10 into a 3' octa for fill. The result keeps the atmosphere of the room while separating the subject from the crowd just off frame.

Below is the lighting diagram I sketched on the flight home:

I'll publish the full contact sheet soon along with notes on color grading the tungsten-heavy practicals.
