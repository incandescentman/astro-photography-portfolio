## WikiPortraits: Fixing Wikipedia's Celebrity Photos

Wikipedia portraits are so famously bad that there's an Instagram page dedicated to them. The reason? Professional photographers rarely contribute because they need to make money from their work. The result is that most celebrities have poor photos on Wikipedia—if they have photos at all.

### The Problem

No professional photographers ever have their photos on Wikipedia, because they want to make money from the photos. It's often just someone with an iPhone catching a celebrity at an airport. This creates a huge gap in quality between what you'd expect for notable public figures and what actually appears on their Wikipedia pages.

### Our Mission

WikiPortraits is a team of volunteer photographers on a mission to provide high-quality, freely-licensed portraits for Wikipedia and the public domain. We bring studio-quality equipment and expertise to capture celebrities in their best light.

**What makes us different:**

- **Professional Quality**: Studio-level equipment and lighting
- **Global Reach**: Our photos are used on Wikipedia articles in over 120 languages, viewed 80+ million times monthly
- **Diversity Focus**: We prioritize photographing underrepresented people to address Wikipedia's diversity gaps

### A Success Story: Jeremy Strong

When we found Jeremy Strong of *Succession* at a New York screening, his Wikipedia photo was from 2014. His publicist said no to a new photo, but Jeremy overruled:

> "Wait, you're from Wikipedia? For the love of God, please take down that photo. You'd be doing me a service."
>
> — Jeremy Strong

We took his portrait on the spot, and it's now his official Wikipedia image.

### Covering Major Events

Our photographers attend prestigious events worldwide:

- **Sundance Film Festival** — Capturing independent film talent
- **Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF)** — Major premieres and red carpets
- **SXSW** — Tech and entertainment innovators
- **Nobel Prize Ceremonies** — Laureates and thought leaders
- **Jaipur Literature Festival** — Authors and intellectuals

### Why It Matters

As WikiPortraits cofounder Kevin Payravi puts it:

> "This is cheesy, but a picture's worth a thousand words. The picture you see that comes up first in Google results is Wikipedia—that's the thing people are going to see first and recognize you as."
