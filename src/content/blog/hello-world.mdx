Welcome to the new studio log. I’ll use this space to unpack in-progress shoots, share lighting diagrams, and document the experiments that rarely make it into finished case studies.

The Cloudinary integration lets me drop a public ID into the frontmatter and automatically generate responsive art direction on the page. Expect behind-the-scenes frames like this one, plus contact sheets, lighting diagrams, and LensLab experiments.

Stay tuned for a deeper dive into the recent Nobel portraits and the AI-assisted retouching workflow I’ve been refining this year.
