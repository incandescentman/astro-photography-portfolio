* Current Repository State
- Blog ("Journal") is live at `src/pages/blog/` with listing + detail templates.
- Blog entries live in `src/content/blog/*.mdx` with frontmatter fields (`image`, `imagePublicId`, etc.).
- `@jaydixit/astro-utils` is installed; we import typography helpers and shared block styles, but we do not depend on the package's unpublished image component.
- Cloudinary helpers (`cldUrl`, `cldSrcset`, `cldSizes`) are centralized in `src/lib/cloudinary.ts`.
- Navigation includes a "Journal" link; blog pages add top padding so the fixed nav does not crop content.
- Two sample posts exist (`hello-world.mdx`, `nobel-portrait-session.mdx`), each referencing Cloudinary imagery.
- `design-architecture.org` and `docs/work-log.org` are updated to reflect the journal architecture and Cloudinary workflow.

* Key Discussions & Decisions
- Journal posts will use local images for now; Cloudinary references remain optional via `imagePublicId`.
- The larger searchable photo index will be powered by the Cloudinary pipeline defined in `cloudinary-setup.org` (CLI uploads → Content Collections → Cloudinary transforms).
- The searchable gallery spec (data schema, CLI, album JSON files) already lives in `cloudinary-setup.org`; the UI is yet to be implemented.
- Blog hero imagery relies on plain `<img>` tags populated via the Cloudinary helpers for responsive `srcset/sizes`.
- `@jaydixit/astro-utils` currently provides smart quotes + typography styles, but we intentionally avoid components that aren’t published in the package dist.

* Next Steps
1. **Data Prep for Searchable Gallery**
   - Run the Cloudinary upload CLI on representative folders so `src/content/albums/*.json` exists with full metadata (tags, captions, people fields).
   - Confirm the JSON content contains everything the future UI will need (event tags, city, people arrays, etc.).

2. **Search Page Implementation**
   - Scaffold a Cloudinary-backed explorer (likely `src/pages/photos/index.astro`): search input, tag filters, optional people facet, grid layout using the same Cloudinary helpers.
   - Decide whether the search is client-side only (load all albums once) or whether to build a serialized index during the CLI step.

3. **Blog Content**
   - Add real journal entries under `src/content/blog/`, pointing to local or Cloudinary imagery as needed.
   - Wire any additional typography/components from `@jaydixit/astro-utils` (e.g., smart quotes in body content) if desired.

4. **Cloudinary Config**
   - Ensure `.env` still includes `PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` (`dszpm7yps`) and `PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_TRANSFORM=gallery` for consistent hero rendering.
   - Create a named transform in the Cloudinary console if not already done (`gallery` with `c_fill,g_auto,f_auto,q_auto`).

5. **Testing**
   - After content or UI changes, run `npm run build` to confirm routes generate cleanly (watch for `albums` warnings if the content collection is empty).
